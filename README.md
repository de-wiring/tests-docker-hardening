This is a serverspec-based test-suite for hardening Docker hosts. It covers a number of aspects on the host and the configuration of a docker daemon.
It's aspects are configurable, i.e. if TLS is not used, all TLS-based checks can be disabled. It fits nicely in a test driven approach where 
serverspec is already used as system and configuration management validation.

## Prerequisites

* Ruby (1.9.3+)
* Bundler

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/de-wiring/tests-docker-hardening.git
$ cd tests-docker-hardening
$ bundle install
```

Bundler will install rake, serverspec and some dependencies. After that serverspec's can be executed.

## Usage

Rakefile will scan for all directories in CWD and build a serverspec task for it. The `default` directory can be used right away:

```bash
# bundle exec rake serverspec:default
(...)
```

This will normally throw a lot of spec errors, since not all aspects are needed.
The Spec is divided in sections
* 1: host level
* 2: daemon configuration
* 3: additional daemon configuration files

## Configuration

It is possible to disable individual sections and subsections. The `spec_helper_hardening.rb` contains methods for modifying section content, controllable by environment variables, i.e. DH_DISABLE_CAT disables sections by category.
Possible values for categories are:
* **tls** No checks for TLS certs and keys
* **systemd** No checks for systemd-related configuration and files
* **docker-registry** No checks for docker systemd registry services
* **docker-network** No checks for docker systemd network services
* **docker-storage** No checks for docker systemd storage services

```bash
# DH_DISABLE_CAT="tls systemd" bundle exec rake serverspec:default
```
